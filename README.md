# **Emission of Co2 From Cars**
The Title itself indicates that it is about Carbondioxide emissions.Yes,The amount of CO2 emission from the transport sector (including cars)
accounts for about 20% of total CO2 emissions.To find out the Emission of Co2 from a particular Car,we build a model to predict the co2 emission 
based on Some features like make,model year,cylinders,engine,Previous co2 emission values,fuel_comb type and other.

### Motivation
we as a team done this project to know our learnings in Machine Learning and to complete our Internship in Smartbridge which is a good platform to 
learn different courses.

### Code style
- We build this model using Random forest classifier.

### Features
By using this algorithm depends upon our input data the output
of the vehicle are going to predict the co2 emission of that
particular car.

### How to use?
- First,Download all the files present in the repository.
- Open Anaconda command prompt in your System
- copy the path of the app.py file and paste it in anaconda cmd prompt.
- This shows your file running url.Copy it and paste in browser and That's it Now you can enter the values to predict Co2 Emission. 

**NOTE:** All the values you entered should be in integer format itself.
- If you enter into login page,you will be asked to enter username and password details.
